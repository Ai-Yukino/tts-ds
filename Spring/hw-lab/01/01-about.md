## Assignment: Tell Us About Yourself

Please write a bit about yourself, telling me whatever you would like to disclose about your personal, professional, or educational backgrounds as you see fit. If you would like me to look at your LinkedIn Profile or Resume/cv, you are welcome to submit them here. I would love to know about your background in coding, and what you are currently spending your time doing! Please tell me about your goals as well, for this class, but also for your future if you are willing to share that information.
