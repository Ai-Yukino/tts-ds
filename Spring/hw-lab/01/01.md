HW: `Assignment: Tell Us About Yourself`

Hello! I'm a returning TTS student primarily interested in developer experience and mathematical modeling. My current target is a remote front-end job, and my long-term goal is a data science role that allows me to do deterministic modeling and scientific computing (e.g. see any of [Nathan Kutz](http://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/)'s plenary talks such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSPPGtbY2pE).)

As far as developer experience goes, I'm always interested in trying and advocating for new tools that can make coding more productive and enjoyable. For example, look at `Winter/python-setup.md` in this repo to see instructions to use `mamba` and `conda-forge` as a faster and community-driven alternative to the `conda` environment manger and `anaconda` package channel. I also advocated for using [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) in my previous TTS course in fullstack web development as a much faster and lightweight alternative to `create-react-app`.

My goal with this course is to learn basic data science skills and start building a strong data science portfolio. My LinkedIn is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ai-yukino/) and my resume is the file `01/ay-resume.pdf` in this repo if you're curious.
